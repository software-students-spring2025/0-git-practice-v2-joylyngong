It's fascinating to see the gradual progression that technology has imprinted on the fashion industry, as we are seeing more sophisticated tools being used for consumers to 
elevate their fashion style. We are noticing this especially with 3D design software and AI-driven analyses used for brands to monitor new trends that are arising from new 
and old retail departments. While ads are a part of the reason of this growth, sustainability has been another topic of discussion for users and creators. Virtual models 
have been used in designs and ways to reduce physical samples to be worn on models. Additionally, companies such as Coach have put up Augmented Reality mirrors for customers 
to pair different outfit pieces of their liking, helping with overall customer satisfaction.
